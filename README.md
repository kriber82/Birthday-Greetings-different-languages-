# Birthday-Greetings-different-languages-

I created this repository to collect versions of the "Birthday Greetings" Kata in different languages.

Big thanks to [Matteo Vaccari](https://github.com/xpmatteo) for creating the [original kata](https://github.com/xpmatteo/birthday-greetings-kata) and the accompanying [blog post](https://matteo.vaccari.name/blog/archives/154).

I am also grateful to various contributors, whose translations of the kata to various languages I have used:
- TODO add contributors
